    "Advantages of Multithreading :- \n",
    "1. Improved Performance: Multithreading improves the performance of applications by running the task simultaneously.\n",
    "2. Better Responsiveness: Multithreading improves the responsiveness of your backend applications by running threads after a task is blocked. It helps in handling multiple user requests in a real-time application.\n",
    "3. Scalability: Multithreading improves the scalability of an application by letting developers add more processors. It is useful when handling a large, growing number of users on a server.\n",
    "4. Latency: Multithreading reduces the time of user requests in applications that need immediate attention. The threads work in sync to process the requests and responses.\n",
    "5. Real-time processing: Multithreading ensures tasks or requests are executed with little delay and maintains a smooth performance during real-time data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading :- \n",
    "1. Difficulty of writing code\n",
    "Multithreaded and multicontexted applications are not easy to write. Only experienced programmers should undertake coding for these types of applications.\n",
    "2. Difficulty of debugging\n",
    "It is much harder to replicate an error in a multithreaded or multicontexted application than it is to do so in a single-threaded, single-contexted application. As a result, it is more difficult, in the former case, to identify and verify root causes when errors occur.\n",
    "3. Difficulty of managing concurrency\n",
    "The task of managing concurrency among threads is difficult and has the potential to introduce new problems into an application.\n",
    "4. Difficulty of testing\n",
    "Testing a multithreaded application is more difficult than testing a single-threaded application because defects are often timing-related and more difficult to reproduce."
